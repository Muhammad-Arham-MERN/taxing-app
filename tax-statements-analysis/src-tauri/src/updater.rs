//! The updater: one background check against the release endpoint.
//!
//! This is the only part of the application that talks to the network. The work
//! is deliberately kept off the startup path, so an endpoint that cannot be
//! reached, a machine with no connection, or a release that fails signature
//! verification costs startup nothing and is never allowed to hold up the
//! window or the store.
//!
//! The endpoint serves a static `latest.json` naming the installer for this
//! platform together with its signature. The plugin accepts that installer only
//! when the signature was produced by the private key matching the `pubkey` in
//! `tauri.conf.json` — that key, not this code, is what makes an update
//! trustworthy.
